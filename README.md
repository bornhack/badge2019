# Bornhack Badge 2019

## About the hardware

Like the previous two years this years badge is again using the SiLabs Happy Gecko
microcontroller. This year it's sporting a 240x240 pixel screen with 6x6x6-bit colour
resolution, a MicroSD card reader and some basic IR communication.

We have separated the hardware design files from the code and put them in the
[hardware branch][hardware] for you to have a look at and build on.

You can download the microcontroller [reference manual][manual] and
[datasheet][] directly from [SiliconLabs][silabs].

## About the code

This repo is meant as a starting point for developing your own code
for the Bornhack 2019 badge. Like the previous years we're using the
[geckonator][] library, but this year everything is split out
into separate source files. Every file ending in `.c` will
automatically be included in the build.

This way it should be easy to add your own code in a separate file
and add it to the main menu in `main.c`.
Have a look at `buttontest.c`, `showbmp.c` or `dumpir.c` for examples.

For reading the partition table and FAT filesystem on an SD-card we're using
the [FatFs][] library.

## Hack your own badge

### 1. Install dependencies

##### Archlinux
```sh
pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib make
```

##### Debian/Ubuntu
```sh
apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi make
```

##### Fedora
```sh
dnf install arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib make
```

##### NixOS/Nix
```sh
nix-shell
```

##### OSX

Download an arm-none-eabi toolchain from ARM [here][arm-toolchain].
Unpack the tarball and update your PATH variable to point to the unpacked `bin` directory.

##### Windows
###### Option 1
Download the apropriate installer from ARM [here][arm-toolchain].
Install it and update your path.
You'll also need GNU Make installed.
A pre-built version can be downloaded [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

###### Option 2

Use Windows Subsystem for Linux with Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial or newer and proceed as on Ubuntu above.

### 2. Get the source code

If you already have git installed
```
git clone https://github.com/bornhack/badge2019.git
cd badge2019
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Otherwise you can download a tarball or zip file from
[https://github.com/bornhack/badge2019](https://github.com/bornhack/badge2019)

### 3. Build the code

Simply type `make` in the downloaded directory.
This should produce a file called `code.bin` in the `out` directory.

### 4. Update your badge

1. Connect a USB cable to the board and your computer.
2. Press the **BOOT** button on the badge.
3. Copy `out/code.bin` to the `GECKOBOOT` USB stick that appeared on your computer.
4. Eject (or unmount) the USB stick, and watch your code run.

Alternatively if you have [dfu-utils][] installed step 3 and 4 can be replaced by typing
`make dfu` in the source repository.
